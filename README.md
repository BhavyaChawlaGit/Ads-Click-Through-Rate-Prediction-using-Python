# Ads-Click-Through-Rate-Prediction-using-Python

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/clickthrough-rate-prediction?resource=download


This project aims to predict the click-through rate (CTR) for advertisements. It utilizes a RandomForestClassifier model from scikit-learn to perform the prediction based on the provided dataset.

Ads Click-through rate prediction means predicting whether the user will click on the ad. In the task of ads click-through rate prediction, we need to train a Machine Learning model to find relationships between the characteristics of all the users who click on ads.

## Features

- Data visualization using Plotly
- Machine Learning model for CTR prediction
- Streamlit web interface for interactive exploration
